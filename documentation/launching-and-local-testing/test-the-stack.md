In this page we provide more useful command to check for all the services and not only the accessible ones.&#x20;

To check the data flow using the accessible services only check [flow-of-the-data.md](../design-and-architecture/flow-of-the-data.md "mention").

To check the results of processing the data in each service, you can check the logs by running the following command:

`docker service logs <name_of_the_service>`
