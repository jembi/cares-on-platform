# The Source: Platform

The source of the components is the project [`Platform`](https://github.com/jembi/platform).

Platform is the general implementation, it contains a set of packages that have a basic configuration.&#x20;

Cares on platform will use some of these packages and it will override the basic config to fulfill its own purpose.
